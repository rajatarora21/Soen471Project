The purpose of the analysis is to efficiently implement a screening process for potential employees. Inorder to screen thousands of applications, the native process can be time consuming and costly. Moreover,companies would know if a candidate is interested in the job. The required dataset contains insightful information to help classify the candidates according to their experience, education, demographics and so on.
